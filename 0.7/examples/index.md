  `Vizzu` offers a shorthand for, as described in the
  [Chart presets](../tutorial/chart_presets.md) chapter of the Tutorial.
- [Animated charts](./animated/index.md): Simple animations from one well-known
  chart to another to provide you with inspiration and reusable code for some
  transitions.
- [Static charts](./static/index.md): Examples of well-known chart types
  configured with the original chart type-agnostic syntax of `Vizzu`.
