## Aggregate/drill-down

These features basically mean that you add or remove an additional dimension 
to/from an axis or another channel. As you can see below, there are some 
important things to keep in mind when you use them.

Letâ€™s stack together the elements by putting the Genres dimension from the 
x-axis to the y-axis. At the end of this phase, there are chart elements with 
the same color stacked on top of each other, which is something you would want 
to avoid. 

```javascript { "title": "Stack" }
chart.animate({
	config: {
		channels: {
			y: { attach: ['Genres'] },
			x: { set: null }
		}
	}
})
```

By taking the Genres off of the y-axis, only one chart element remains for every 
color, and Vizzu automatically calculates and shows the aggregate value of the 
elements. 

Note: Instead of taking the unwanted dimension down from the chart, Genres could 
have been added to the lightness channel to differentiate the chart elements.

```javascript { "title": "Aggregate elements" }
chart.animate({
	config: {
		channels: {
			y: { detach: ['Genres'] }
		}
	}
})
```

To drill-down, the same dimension is put back on the y-axis, which results in a 
state that we suggest you to only use temporarily when in transition.

```javascript { "title": "Drill-down" }
chart.animate({
	config: {
		channels: {
			y: { attach: ['Genres'] }
		}
	}
})
```

We group the elements by putting once again the Genres dimension on the x-axis.

```javascript { "title": "Group" }
chart.animate({
	config: {
		channels: {
			y: { detach: ['Genres'] },
			x: { set: ['Genres'] }
		}
	}
})
```
